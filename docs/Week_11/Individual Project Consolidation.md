# Week 11: Individual Project Consolidation

## Purpose

This section consolidates my individual project contributions completed throughout Weeks 5–10 and confirms the final state of my work for project handover.

No new model or prototype was developed in Week 11. The focus was on finalising, documenting and organising the existing project artefacts.

## Final Individual Contribution

My completed individual work includes:

* Data exploration and preparation.
* Baseline machine-learning modelling.
* Model comparison and evaluation.
* Feature engineering and model optimisation.
* Selection of the final proof-of-concept model.
* Reproducible project structure and handover documentation.
* HCI/HRI prototype development.
* Safety, failure-handling and accessibility considerations.

## Final Model Decision

The **Logistic Regression model** was retained as the final proof-of-concept model.

It achieved the strongest Macro-F1 result among the evaluated models:

**Macro-F1: 0.495**

The model is intended for **clinical decision support only** and should not autonomously determine patient triage priority.

The limited ESI 1 recall remains an important safety limitation and means that further validation is required before clinical deployment.

## Final System Position

The proposed system follows a human-in-the-loop workflow:

**Patient information → AI recommendation → Clinician review → Final clinical decision**

The clinician remains responsible for the final triage decision.

The finalized project also includes the nurse-facing HCI dashboard and the Observation Unit HRI concept developed during Week 9.

## Reproducibility and Handover

The repository has been organised so that another developer or researcher can understand the project, locate the relevant artefacts and reproduce the modelling workflow.

Final project components include:

* Source code
* Configuration
* Model artefact
* Documentation
* Model results
* HCI/HRI prototypes
* Handover information

## Final Limitations

The current proof of concept is limited by:

* Single-site Caribbean dataset.
* Class imbalance.
* Limited ESI 1 recall.
* No prospective clinical validation.
* No external validation.
* No live ED deployment.
* Further accessibility and usability testing required.

## Week 11 Completion

The individual project work is now consolidated and documented in the repository.

The final implementation remains a **proof of concept**, with Logistic Regression retained as the preferred model and human clinical oversight maintained as a core deployment requirement.
